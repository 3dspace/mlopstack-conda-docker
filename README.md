# mlopstack-conda-docker
ML model training and deployment using Conda, Jupyter, Git, VSCode, FastAPI, and Docker.

I watched a presentation called "Beyond Jupyter Notebooks", where this combination of tools was presented as an "open source MLOps stack".

This repo contains code and notes from tutorials and experiments where I learned to integrate all these tools into a hassle-free full-stack cloud-connected ML workbench in my laptop.
